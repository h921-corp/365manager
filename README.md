# 365manager
a commandline tool which grants the same abilities as TrustedInstaller<br>
I got the idea from a John Hammond video and thought to make it into a usable CLI tool<br>
# Usage
Prebuilt binary
<hr>
Download the prebuilt binary from the releases tab.<br>
Open a CMD window, and navigate to the place where you placed the binary.<br>
After that, just run the EXE from the CMD window, and you should be elevated!<br>
<br>
Compiling
<hr>
Download the source code, and compile it using whatever you want (cl, gcc, ...)<br>
Open a CMD window, and navigate to the output directory of the compiler<br>
After that, just run the EXE from the CMD window, and you should be elevated!<br>
